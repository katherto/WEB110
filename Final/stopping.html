                <div class="pageContent">
                    <p>
                        Identifying there's an issue with the spread of misinformation is important, but it's even more important to put a stop to it. 
                        While an impervious catch-all solution would be best, the unfortunate reality is almost anything won't ever be the perfect solution. 
                        However, here are some options for cleaning up this internet mess:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Social Media Responses During an Attack</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an event is unfolding, people will almost always take to social media to update loved ones and interested parties on the events happening. 
                        Instead of using personal and eyewitness accounts to report, social media can take initiative to promote official police accounts and reports as they happen.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Transferring Engagement Statistics</h3>
                    <p>
                        This can also be seen as parallel to editing a post.  However, on sites like Twitter where that isn't possible, being able to delete an old post, create a new one, 
                        and carry over the engagement statistics from the old post to the new could help with correct information retaining visibility.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Establishing Trust in the Source of Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        A study [<a href="https://kf-site-production.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/pdfs/000/000/254/original/KnightFoundation_Misinformation_Report_FINAL_3_.PDF">PDF</a>] by the Knight Foundation in 2018 examined over 1,400 people regarding how they view news sources and if they perceive what they read or hear as misinformation. 
                        What they find is various groups of people by ages and political leanings all perceiving news and misinformation differently.  
                        However, as part of the conclusion from their survey results, Knight Foundation believes one such solution may come from repairing trust in the media for those who have lost it.
