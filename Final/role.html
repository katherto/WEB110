                <h2>How Rampant is the Spread of Misinformation</h2>
                <div class="pageContent">
                    <p>
                        While the spread of misinformation on the internet is concerning, there are a number of ways that information is running amok.  
                        We briefly <a href="concern.html">touched</a> on the idea of an echo chamber and how users on a forum with little to no moderation can affirm themselves 
                        of their ideas by sharing it with those that are like-minded.  
                        Social media is a big contributor for how misinformation is running rampant on the internet.

                            For instance, lets first look at the structure of a social media website's feed of information.  Both Facebook and Twitter have 
                            a story feed that acts as your default landing page and keeps you informed of the various stories and actions of your contacts or 
                            people you follow.  Typically that information is sorted by "top" as opposed to "recent."  While seemingly harmless, this style of 
                            presenting information prioritizes articles or events that cultivate lots of user interaction.
                        </p>
                    </div><!--closing overflow div-->
                    <p>
                        Suppose, then, that a post or article is shared regarding a current event and it brings about lots of interaction from people exposed 
                        to the article.  However, that article contains incorrect information and as a result garners negative reactions. 
                        At a later time, the article then corrects the misinformation as the story developed and was brought to light in a later post.  In this instance, 
                        social media is presenting the misinformation and prioritizing its visibility due to user interaction, when in fact the issues were corrected later 
                        and become not as visible due to their sorting algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn't too far-fetched either as it's exactly what happened during a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/09/how-misinformation-spreads-on-social-media-and-what-to-do-about-it/">recent attack</a> in Toronto on April 23, 2018. 
                        As the attack took place, a CBC journalist tweeted about an eyewitness account about the attacker's identity. 
                        The witness incorrectly identified the perpetrator as angry and Middle Eastern, which, after CBC's journalist posted the information it lead to the general public jumping to conclusions 
                        without the correct information and usage of derogatory and racist terms to describe the attacker and the incident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately, in the Toronto event's case the eyewitness account was later rescinded and the attacker correctly identified.  However, the damage had already been done and Twitter's systems were not appropriately 
                        notifying users of the corrected information.  The initial tweet had such a viral reaction and thus was more visible, whereas the correct information later followed and was overlooked by users  
                        due to Twitter's reply system and the smaller amount of user engagement.
