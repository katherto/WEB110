                    <p>
                        Today's always on-line society is currently at risk should we continue the path we're on without control.  
                        The propagation of misinformation has already begun to hurt people around the world, and if left unchecked has the potential to even undo scientific advancements.  
                        In fact, we're already witnessing the effects of widespread misinformation on popular social media websites such as Facebook or Twitter.  
                        People use these spaces on the web as a forum to speak with others who are of like-mindedness.  
                        In so doing, they're creating a sort of echo chamber for themselves.  An opinion or piece of information can be shared in one of these echo chambers, 
                        and due to the like-mindedness of the individuals of that forum the information is supported and echoed by the other members.
                        The dangerous part of this model is what if the information is wrong or has been scientifically proven incorrect?

                        The impact of misinformation is having an affect on people's health.  All over the world we're beginning to see a resurgence of Measles outbreaks.  
                        This is a preventable disease which has had a working vaccine distributed to people at a young age in order to eradicate the disease.  
                        However, in recent day with these social media echo chambers and spread of misinformation, people are distrusting vaccines in general as they're believing the misinformation regarding side effects of those vaccines.

                                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has tracked through the years the amount of measles cases being reported.  
                                It can be observed in the past five years the lowest point of measles cases was in 2016 with 86 cases being reported.  
                                Since then we've seen an increase in the number of cases, with the most measles cases being reported in 2019 so far (through May 3rd of this year).  
                                This isn't enough data to determine a cause and effect analysis of the impact of misinformation directly relating to the increase of measles cases.  
                                However, the propagation of misinformation being echoed by uninformed people is contributing to their choice of choosing to vaccinate themselves or their children.  
                                Choosing to not vaccinate is dangerous as it damages what's called the herd immunity.  
                                This herd immunity is what protects individuals who are vaccinated, and those who aren't (typically due to medical conditions preventing a person from being able to vaccinate themselves).

                        Increasing cases of Measles and continued reporting of outbreaks in the world is just one problem facing us as misinformation continues to plague our online spaces.  
                        Recently, the World Wide Web had its 30th anniversary.  On March 12, 2019, Sir Tim Berners-Lee published his <a href="https://webfoundation.org/2019/03/web-birthday-30/">annual memo</a> regarding the state of the web.  
                        In this memo he specifically calls attention to issues facing our web, stating 
                        "system design that creates perverse incentives where user value is sacrificed, such as ad-based revenue models that commercially reward clickbait and viral spread of misinformation" 
                        as one of his chief concerns.  Berners-Lee, the founder of the web, is recognizing misinformation as a problem and is working with the World Wide Web Foundation to introduce a "Contract for the Web" 
                        in an effort to correct this issue among others.

                    <p>
                        It can be clearly stated that rampant spread of misinformation is a big issue facing our world, which, begs the question <a href="page3.html">how do we stop it?</a>
